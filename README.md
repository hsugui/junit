# Java Unit Testing with JUnit 5 Course Project
This repository contains exercises and code from a course on Practical Java Unit Testing with JUnit 5. The course focuses on writing high-quality unit tests, creating real-world test scenarios, and learning basic Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

Course: [Practical Java Unit Testing with JUnit 5](https://www.udemy.com/course/junit5-for-beginners/).  
Created by Adrian Wiech.

> I’ll introduce only the essential theory behind unit testing, and then dive straight into the code to get you started as quickly as possible. I’ll use an example of a simple, yet practical Java project to show you a variety of unit test types. You'll also learn the best practices and coding standards for unit tests based on my developing experience. You can get started in just a few hours. This course also comes with additional exercises and a one-page cheat sheet for a quick JUnit 5 reference.
